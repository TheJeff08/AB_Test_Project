# AB_Test_Project

This project takes data about a UI change and runs an A/B test to see if the change can quantifiably be better.
This is a slight variation on a project that I found an article about and did alongside the educator in order to learn how to think through doing these kinds of experiments.

The ipynb contains the work as well as my thoughts and process throughout in the comments.
